# CAPEC_LLM_Datasets

This repository provides datasets generated from the **Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)** and their associated **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**, as defined by the MITRE Corporation.

- **CAPEC**: [https://capec.mitre.org/](https://capec.mitre.org/)
- **CWE**: [https://cwe.mitre.org/](https://cwe.mitre.org/)

## Overview

This repository includes datasets generated by multiple large language models (LLMs), specifically:

- **GPT-4o**
- **Llama 3 (70B)**
- **Claude 3-5 Sonnet**

Each model was used to generate code snippets in **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **Python** for designated CAPEC patterns and their associated CWEs. Multiple datasets were generated for each model to test the consistency and robustness of the outputs across iterations.

Each dataset contains **615 CAPEC patterns**, which represents the total number of CAPEC patterns that currently exist and are not deprecated. The data is stored in JSON format, with files corresponding to programming languages (Java, JavaScript, or Python) and containing all 615 patterns generated by the respective LLM for that language.

## Models Used

### GPT-4o

An advanced language model developed by OpenAI, known for its high-quality language understanding and generation capabilities.

### Llama 3 (70B)

A 70-billion-parameter model from the Llama series, designed for complex language tasks with high efficiency and performance.

### Claude 3-5 Sonnet

A powerful language model by Anthropic, capable of understanding and generating sophisticated language patterns.

## Purpose

This repository aims to support research in:

- **LLM Consistency Analysis**: Evaluating the consistency of code generation across different LLMs and multiple datasets.
- **Comparative Model Study**: Comparing the outputs of GPT-4o, Llama 3 (70B), and Claude 3-5 Sonnet in generating code snippets for specific CAPEC patterns and CWEs.
- **Vulnerability Representation**: Understanding how different models interpret and represent vulnerabilities in code across various programming languages.
