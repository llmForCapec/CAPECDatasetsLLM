# CAPEC_LLM_Datasets

This repository provides datasets generated from the **Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)** and their associated **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)**, as defined by the MITRE Corporation.

- **CAPEC**: [https://capec.mitre.org/](https://capec.mitre.org/)
- **CWE**: [https://cwe.mitre.org/](https://cwe.mitre.org/)

## Overview

This repository includes datasets generated by multiple large language models (LLMs), specifically:

- **GPT-4o**
- **Llama 3 (70B)**
- **Claude 3-5 Sonnet**

Each model was used to generate code snippets in **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **Python** for designated CAPEC patterns and their associated CWEs. Multiple runs were conducted for each model to test the consistency and robustness of the outputs across iterations.

## Models Used

### GPT-4o

An advanced language model developed by OpenAI, known for its high-quality language understanding and generation capabilities.

### Llama 3 (70B)

A 70-billion-parameter model from the Llama series, designed for complex language tasks with high efficiency and performance.

### Claude 3-5 Sonnet

A powerful language model by Anthropic, capable of understanding and generating sophisticated language patterns.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/gpt-4o/**
  - **/run1/** to **/run5/**
    - **/JavaScript/**
    - **/Java/**
    - **/Python/**
- **/llama-3-70b/**
  - **/run1/** to **/run5/**
    - **/JavaScript/**
    - **/Java/**
    - **/Python/**
- **/claude-3-5-sonnet/**
  - **/run1/** to **/run5/**
    - **/JavaScript/**
    - **/Java/**
    - **/Python/**

Each **run** directory represents a separate generation iteration. Inside each, code snippets are organized by programming language to facilitate easy access and analysis.

## Purpose

This repository aims to support research in:

- **LLM Consistency Analysis**: Evaluating the consistency of code generation across different LLMs and multiple runs.
- **Comparative Model Study**: Comparing the outputs of GPT-4o, Llama 3 (70B), and Claude 3-5 Sonnet in generating code snippets for specific CAPEC patterns and CWEs.
- **Vulnerability Representation**: Understanding how different models interpret and represent vulnerabilities in code across various programming languages.

## Usage

To utilize the datasets:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CAPEC_LLM_Datasets.git
